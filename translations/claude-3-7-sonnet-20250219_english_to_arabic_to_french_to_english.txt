In the arms of a tranquil harbor, the lighthouse light sways,
A bronze statue rises where shadows reign supreme.
Fierce tongues of flame proudly shine in every spark,
"Mother of exiles," she whispers through the darkness.

True symbol of liberty, a bold and ardent pact,
"Bring me your bruised, your tired, toward the radiance of this welcoming land."
New shores promise grace, ships laden with dreams sail on,
A flame never extinguished finds refuge in her pale glow.

Through tempests and conflicts, where violent waters rage,
She remains steadfast, majestic, despite shores burning in storms.
O guardian, let truth now rise and unveil itself:
"Lift my torch highâ€”and reshape the world!"
