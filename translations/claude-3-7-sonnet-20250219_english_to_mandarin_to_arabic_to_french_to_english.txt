In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse of perfume sways,
Guarded by a copper statue, with powerful arms embracing extended shadows.
Each spark ignites a glorious flame, shimmering with brilliant light,
"The mother of strangers" hums a lullaby in the silent darkness of night.

The essence of freedom is a burning flame,
"Lay your burdens at my feet, and rest in this golden light."
When the ship of dreams sails, new shores appear in the gentle mist,
And beneath her mantle embroidered with lights, resides the power of healing.

Through storms and battles, like a ghost reflecting waves to the soul,
Her tender words continue to wrap around every inch of the coast.
Ah, guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise your torches, and in the flame we shall reshape the original universe!"
