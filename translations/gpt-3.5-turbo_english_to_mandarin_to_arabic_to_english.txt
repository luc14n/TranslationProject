In a tranquil harbor, a lighthouse sways with a fragrant gleam,
A bronze guardian embraces the shadow with his majestic arm.
Every spark ignites a burning desire, shining with radiant light,
"The Mother of Exile" sings softly in a quiet night.

The essence of freedom is a bright sparkle,
"Surrender your burden to me, rest in this golden halo."
As the ship of dreams sails, new shores smile beyond the light mist,
Finding solace beneath its radiant cloak.

After enduring storms and conflicts, like the sea waves revealing the soul,
She remains calm, embracing the shores with gentle words.
Oh guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise the torch, in the flames, we shall rebuild the heavens and the earth!"
