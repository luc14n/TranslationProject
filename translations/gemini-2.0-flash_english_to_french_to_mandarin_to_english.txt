In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways with fragrant radiance,
A bronze sentinel embraces the shadows with majestic arms.
Each spark ignites fervent yearning, shimmering with dazzling light,
The "Mother of Exiles" softly croons amidst the silent night's procession.

The essence of freedom is a brilliant gleam,
"Give me your weary burdens, rest them within this golden halo."
As ships of dreams set sail, new shores smile through the mist,
Finding solace beneath her shimmering gown.

Through storms and strife, baring souls like ocean waves,
She remains serene, soothing the coast with gentle whispers.
O guardian, unveil the truth they seek:
"Raise the torch highâ€”in the flame, we shall reshape the heavens and earth!"
