In the quiet harbor, the lighthouse sways with fragrant light,
And the bronze guardian embraces shadows with his glorious arms.
Each spark ignites a burning desire, glittering and dazzling,
And the "Mother of Exiles" hums softly in the silent night's procession.

The essence of freedom is a radiant courage,
"Give me your tired burdens in this golden halo."
When ships of dreams sail, new shores smile through the fog,
And beneath her shimmering robe they find solace.

Through storms and struggles, like waves revealing her soul,
She remains calm, cradling the shore with elegant whispers.
Oh, guardian, reveal the truth they seek:
"Lift the torch - we shall reshape the world in flame!"
