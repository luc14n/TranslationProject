In the embrace of the harbor, a shining lighthouse,
A giant of bronze, a hopeful sight.
With a lofty lamp, a welcoming gleam,
"The Mother of Refugees," a whispered dream.
A symbol of freedom, a sincere pledge,
"Give me your tired, your poor."
A promised land, where dreams soar,
A lighthouse of hope, burning brightly.
Across turbulent seas and vast oceans,
It stands as a beacon, beside its expanse.
A monument to the call of freedom,
"Raise my lamp, for all."
