In the embrace of a tranquil harbor, the lighthouse light dances,
A bronze statue stands tall, ruling over the land of shadows.
Flames burn, each spark carrying pride,
"The Mother of Immigrants," whispers in the dark.

The true symbol of freedom, a bold and bright promise,
"Bring me your tired and troubled, to the light of this welcoming land."
A new beach promises grace, the ship of dreams ready to set sail,
An eternal flame finds sanctuary in her radiance.

Amidst storms and conflicts, when waters rage and boil,
She stands proud, fearless of the storm-lit shores.
Oh, guardian, now let truth stand:
"Lift my flame highâ€”remake, renew this land!"
