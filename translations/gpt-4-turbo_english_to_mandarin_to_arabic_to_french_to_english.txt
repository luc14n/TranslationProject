In the harbor of tranquility, the lighthouse sways with its fragrant light,
A bronze guardian with his wide arms embraces the shadows.
Each spark ignites a burning desire, shimmering with a bright glow,
"The mother of strangers" sings softly in the night of serenity.

The essence of freedom is a bright spark,
"Lay your burden at my feet, rest in this golden halo."
When the ship of dreams sets sail, new beaches smile behind the light fog,
Under its sparkling cloak, you find comfort.

She has crossed through storms and conflicts, as the waves reveal the soul,
Always calm, she embraces the shores with her tender words.
Oh, guardian, show them the truth they seek:
"Raise the torch, in the flame, we will rebuild the sky and the earth!"
