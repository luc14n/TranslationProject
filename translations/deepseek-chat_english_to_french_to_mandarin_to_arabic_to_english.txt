In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways fragrant beams of light,  
guarded by bronze sentinels cradling shadows in their glow.  
Every spark ignites with glowing longing,  
"Mother of exiles" murmurs softly in the silent processions of night.  

The essence of freedom is a radiant courage,  
"Entrust to me, leave the burdens of weariness in this golden halo."  
When dream ships sail, new shores smile beyond the mist,  
in the embrace of her shimmering mantle, solace is found.  

Through storms and strife, like raging waves confessing their depths,  
she remains serene, gently touching the shore, whispering faintly.  
O guardian, guide them to the truth they seek:  
"Raise the torchesâ€”we shall reshape the universe from the flames!"
