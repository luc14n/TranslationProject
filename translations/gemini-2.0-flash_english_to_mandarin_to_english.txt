In harbor's gentle keep, beacon's gleam does play,
A bronze form stands, where shadows hold their sway.
Fierce burns the flame, with pride in every spark,
"Mother of Exiles," whispers in the dark.

True sign of liberty, her vow so bold and bright,
"Bring me your weary, poor, to this land's welcoming light."
New shores that promise grace, dream ships set to roam,
A torch unquenched, its radiance finds a home.

Through tempest, and through strife, where raging waters churn,
She stands unyielding, though storm-lashed coasts do burn.
O Sentinel, with truth now make your stand:
"Lift high my flame â€“ remake, renew the land!"
