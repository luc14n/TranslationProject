In the embrace of tranquil haven, the lighthouse's light dances,
A bronze statue stands tall where shadows are deepest.
Tongues of fervent flame bloom in every spark,
"Mother of Exiles," she whispers in the dark.

A true icon of liberty, a promise bold and keen,
"Bring your wounds, your weariness, into the glow of this ardent scene."
New shores pledge bliss, ships sailing with dreams abound,
An unquenched flame finds sanctuary in her pale renown.

Through tempest and strife, where turbulent waters rage,
Though shores are scorched by storms, she stands in stately age.
Sentinel, may truth now rise and be unfurled:
"Lift high my torchâ€”let us reshape the world!"
