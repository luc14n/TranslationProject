In the harbor's embrace, a shining beacon,  
A bronze colossus, a sight that stirs the soul.  
With a towering flame and a warm glow,  
"Mother of Exiles," a whispered dream.  

A symbol of freedom, a promise true,  
"Bring me your weary, your poor."  
Land of promises, where dreams take flight,  
A beacon of hope, blazing bright.  

Through raging seas and boundless oceans,  
She stands tall, by her vast domain.  
A monument calling for liberty,  
"Lift my torch, to the world entire."
