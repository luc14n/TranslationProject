In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways with fragrant radiance,
The copper guardian stands where light and shadow merge.
Each spark awakens deep and bright yearnings,
The "Mother of Exiles" whispers in the silent night.

True symbol of freedom, shining courage,
"Trust me, place your weary burdens beneath this golden light."
As ships of dreams set sail, new shores smile through the mist,
Finding peace under her shimmering, rippling cloak.

Through storms and conflicts, when wild waves speak,
She remains calm, nourishing shores with humming grace.
Guardian, reveal the true guide they call for:
"Lift high the torchâ€”in its flame, we shall reshape every corner!"
