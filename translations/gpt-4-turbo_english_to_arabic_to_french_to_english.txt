In the arms of a peaceful harbor, the lighthouse light dances,
A bronze statue stands, where shadows prevail.
The fires burn intensely, with pride in every spark,
"The Mother of Migrants," whispers in the darkness.

A true symbol of freedom, a bold and bright commitment,
"Bring me your tormented and your weary, to the light of this welcoming land."
New beaches promise grace, ships of dreams prepare to sail,
A flame that never dies, finds refuge in its glow.

Amidst storms and conflicts, where waters boil with violence,
She stands proud, despite shores inflamed by storms.
O guardian, let the truth now stand:
"Lift my flame high - Reforge, renew the land!"
