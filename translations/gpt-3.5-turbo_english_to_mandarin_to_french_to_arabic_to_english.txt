In a gentle embrace of the Gulf, the perfumed lighthouse trembles,
Watching the bronze statue, its strong arms embracing the extended shadows.
Every spark ignites the flame of glory, shimmering with radiant light,
"The banished mother" whispers a hymn in the still night.

The essence of freedom shines like a bright torch,
"Lay your burden at my feet, rest in this golden light."
As the ship of dreams sails, revealing a new shore in the light mist,
Beneath her robe adorned with light, lies the power of healing.

After the storm and conflict, like a ghost, the waves reflect the depth of the soul,
Her gentle words continue around every inch of the shore.
Oh guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Hold onto your candles, we will reshape the primordial universe in the flames!"
