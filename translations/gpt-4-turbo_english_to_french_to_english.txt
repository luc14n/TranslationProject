In the embrace of refuge, a lighthouse shines,
A bronze giant, a vision that awakens dreams.
With a flame of pride and warmth, it radiates,
"The Mother of Exiles," a whispered hope it offers.

A symbol of freedom, a true promise,
"Welcome your tired, your poor as well."
Land of promise, where dreams take flight,
A beacon of hope, shining so bright.

Across stormy seas and vast oceans,
She stands proud, beside her vast realm.
A monument calling for the defense of liberty,
"Raise my lamp high, so the whole world may spread."
