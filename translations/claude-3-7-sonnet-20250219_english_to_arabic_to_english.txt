In the harbor's embrace, a gleaming lighthouse,
A bronze giant, a soul-stirring sight.
With a proud flame and warm glow,
"Mother of Exiles," a whispered dream.

Symbol of freedom, an honest promise,
"Bring me your tired, your poor."
Land of promises, where dreams soar,
A beacon of hope, shining bright.

Across raging seas and endless oceans,
She stands tall, beside her vast kingdom.
A monument calling for freedom,
"I lift my torch, for the entire world."
