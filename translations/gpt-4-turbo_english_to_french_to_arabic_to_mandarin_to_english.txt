In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways with the light of fragrance,
The bronze guards stand proudly at the intersection of light and shadow.
Each spark ignites the deep desires within,
"The Mother of Wanderers" breathes calmly in the still night.

The true symbol of freedom, radiating courage,
"Trust me, let this golden light relieve your weary burdens."
As the ship of dreams sets sail, new coastlines cheer with joy,
Find solace in her eternal, glowing cloak.

Through storms and battles, as the surging waves whisper,
He stands quietly, once again inspiring the coastal winds.
The guards, revealing the truth in their call:
"Raise the torch of light - in this flame, we shall reshape everything!"
