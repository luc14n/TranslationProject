In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse's radiance gently sways,
Bronze guardian standing where light and shadow intertwine.
Each spark ignites the power of burning passion,
The "Mother of Exiles" breathes in the silence of night.

True symbol of freedom, courage radiating brilliantly,
"Bring your weary burdens into this golden light."
When ships laden with dreams set sail, new shores whisper,
Finding solace in the heart of her eternal luminous garment.

Through storms and battles, where wild tides roar,
She stands quietly, though shores again yearn for wind's arrival.
Guardian, let truth reveal its claim:
"Lift high the torchâ€”we shall remake the world in flame!"
