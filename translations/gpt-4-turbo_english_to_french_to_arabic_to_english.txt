In the tranquil harbors, lighthouses sway with fragrant light,
And bronze guardians stand proudly, where light and shadow meet.
Every spark ignites a deep desire within,
"The Mother of the Displaced" breathes quietly in the still night.

A true symbol of freedom, radiating courage,
"Trust me, unload your weary burdens with this golden light."
As ships of dreams sail, new shores rejoice with joy,
Finding solace in her eternal and radiant cloak.

Through storms and battles, when violent waves whisper,
It stands silently, while inspiring the coast anew with winds.
Guardians, to reveal the truth in their call:
"Raise the torch of light high - in the flame, we shall recreate everything!"
