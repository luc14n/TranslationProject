In the harbor of tranquility, the lighthouse sways with its fragrant light,
A bronze guardian with mighty arms embraces the shadows.
Every spark ignites the blazing desire, shimmering with bright brilliance,
"The Mother of Strangers" sings softly in the night of serenity.

The essence of freedom is a bright spark,
"Set down your burden at my feet, rest in this golden aura."
As the ship of dreams sails, new shores smile behind the gentle fog,
Beneath her sparkling cloak, solace is found.

She has passed through storms and conflicts, as the waves reveal the soul,
Still calm, she embraces the shores with her tender words.
Oh, guardian, show them the truth they seek:
"Lift the torch, in the flame, we shall rebuild the heavens and the earth!"
