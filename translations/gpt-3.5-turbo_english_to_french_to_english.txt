In the embrace of the haven, a lighthouse shines,
A bronze giant, a vision that awakens dreams.
With a flame of pride and warmth, it radiates,
"The Mother of Exiles," a whispered hope bestows.

A symbol of freedom, a true promise,
"Give me your tired, your poor as well."
Land of promise, where dreams take flight,
A lighthouse of hope, shining so bright.

Through stormy seas and vast oceans,
She stands proud, alongside her vast realm.
A monument calling for the defense of liberty,
"Hold high my lamp, so the whole world may expand."
