In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways beams of fragrant light,  
Bronze sentinels embrace shadows with radiant arms.  
Each spark ignites fervent, dazzling yearning,  
"Mother of Exiles" hums softly in night's silent procession.  

Freedom's essence is luminous courage,  
"Entrust to me, lay weary burdens in this gilded halo."  
As dream vessels cast off, new shores smile through the mist,  
Finding solace beneath her shimmering robes.  

Through storms and strife, like waves baring their souls,  
She remains serene, caressing shores with graceful whispers.  
O Watcher, reveal the truth they seek:  
"Raise high the torch—we shall forge heaven and earth anew in flame!"  

(Translation notes:  
1. "parfumé de lumière" rendered as "beams of fragrant light" preserves synesthetic imagery  
2. "Sentinelles de bronze" becomes "Bronze sentinels," maintaining metallic texture while personifying  
3. "La Mère des Exilés" directly translated as "Mother of Exiles" retains cultural significance  
4. "largue les amarres" expressed through nautical idiom "cast off"  
5. Final line's "refaçonnerons chaque lieu" poetically amplified to "forge heaven and earth"  
Rhythm alternates between long and short phrases, balancing French cadence with Chinese lyrical flow)
