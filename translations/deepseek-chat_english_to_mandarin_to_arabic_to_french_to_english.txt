At the tranquil harbor, the scented light of the beacon sways,  
guarded by a bronze statue with mighty arms clasping the lengthening shadows.  
Each spark kindles an incandescent flame, shimmering in dazzling splendor,  
"The Mother of Strangers" hums a gentle song into the motionless night.  

The essence of liberty is a quivering flame,  
"Lay down your burdens at my feet, rest in this golden glow."  
When dream-ships sail, new shores rise from the drifting haze,  
Beneath her cloak embroidered with light lies the power to mend.  

Through storms and battles, like waves mirroring phantoms of souls,  
Still she cloaks every inch of shore with her soothing words.  
O Keeper, unveil for them the truth they seek:  
"Raise the torches highâ€”in the fire's flame, we shall reforge the dawn of worlds!"
