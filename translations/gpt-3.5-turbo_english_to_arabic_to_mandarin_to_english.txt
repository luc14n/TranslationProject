In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse's light dances,
The bronze guardian stands in the place where shadows gather.
In every spark ignites a fierce flame's tongue,
"The Mother of Exiles," breathes through the darkness.

A true symbol of freedom, a brave and bright vow,
"Bring your pain and weariness, come into this warm light."
New shores softly laugh, ships laden with dreams set sail,
The never-dying flame finds solace in her bright robe.

In storms and conflicts, the water surges and roars,
She is majestic and calm, though the beach begs for scorching winds.
Oh, guardian, let the truth rise and spread:
"Hold high my torchâ€”let us reshape the world!"
