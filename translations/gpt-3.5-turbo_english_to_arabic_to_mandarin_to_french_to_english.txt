In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse's light dances,
The bronze guardian stands where the shadow gathers.
Each spark ignites a fierce tongue of fire,
"The mother of exiles" breathes through the darkness.

A true symbol of freedom, a courageous and luminous oath,
"Bring your pains and your weariness, come into this radiant warmth."
The new shores softly laugh, ships laden with dreams set sail,
The eternal flame finds solace in its shining gown.

In the storm and conflicts, the tumultuous waters surge,
She is majestic and calm, despite the pleas of beaches scorched by violent winds.
Oh guardian, let truth rise and spread:
"Wield my torch - let us reshape the world together!"
