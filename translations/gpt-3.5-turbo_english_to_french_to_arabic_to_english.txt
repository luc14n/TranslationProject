In tranquil harbors, lighthouses sway with fragrant light,
Bronze guards stand proudly, where light and shadow meet.
Every spark ignites the deep desire within,
"The mother of the displaced" breathes gently in the quiet night.

A true symbol of freedom, shining courage,
"Trust me, unload your weary burdens with this golden light."
As ships of dreams sail, new shores rejoice with joy,
Finding comfort in its eternal and radiant robe.

Through storms and battles, when fierce waves whisper,
He stands in silence, while the coast inhales the winds anew.
Guardians, to reveal the truth in their call:
"Raise the torch of light high - in the flame, we will recreate everything!"
