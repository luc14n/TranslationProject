Where harbor embraces, the beacon burns bright,  
A colossus of bronze stands firm in the night.  
With flames fierce and proud,  
"Mother of Exiles," whispers soft through the shroud.  

True emblem of freedom, her vow strong and clear,  
"Bring your weary, your poor, let this land draw you near."  
New shores pledge their grace, where dream-ships set sail,  
A torch ever-burning, its light shall not fail.  

Through tempest and tumult, where wild waters roar,  
She stands unshaken, though storms lash the shore.  
O Sentinel, cry with a voice that rings true:  
"Lift high my fireâ€”let the world gleam anew!"
