In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways a thread of fragrant light,
The bronze sentinel, embracing darkness with brightness.
Every spark ignites a deep, bright desire,
"The Mother of Exiles" whispers softly in the night's silent procession.

A true symbol of freedom, radiant courage,
"Trust me, lay your weary burdens beneath this golden light."
As the ship of dreams sets sail, a new shore smiles through thin mist,
Finding solace beneath her shimmering cloak.

Through storms and conflicts, when the surging waves confess,
She remains calm, gracefully brushing the coast with her whispers.
Oh, guardians, reveal the true guidance they call for:
"Raise the torch high - in her flame, we will recreate every place!"
