In the haven's embrace, a beacon gleams,
A bronze giant, a sight that quickens dreams.
With a flame of pride and warmth it glows,
"Mother of Exiles," a whispered hope bestows.

A symbol of freedom, a promise true,
"Give me your weary, your poor, too."
Land of promise, where dreams take flight,
A lighthouse of hope, shining ever so bright.

Across raging seas and oceans wide,
She stands tall, by her vast realm's side.
A monument calling for liberty's stand,
"Lift my lamp, for all the world to expand."
