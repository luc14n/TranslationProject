In the embrace of the harbor, a lighthouse shines its light,
A colossal bronze giant, igniting dreams at night.
With proud and warm flames,
"The Mother of Exiles," whispers hints of hope.

A symbol of freedom, such a true promise,
"Welcome, weary ones, you impoverished souls."
A new land of vows, where dreams set sail,
A beacon of hope, burning with strength.

Through turbulent waters and untamed seas,
She stands unyielded in vast domains.
A monument calling for the defense of freedom,
"Lift my torch high, for the world to benefit."
