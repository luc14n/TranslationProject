In the embrace of a tranquil harbor, the lighthouse light flickers unsteadily,
A bronze statue stands tall, where shadows reign supreme.
Fierce tongues of flame proudly shine in every spark,
"Mother of Exiles," she whispers through the darkness.

True symbol of freedom, a bold and passionate promise,
"Bring me your scarred, your weary ones, toward the light of this welcoming land."
New shores promise grace, ships laden with dreams set sail,
The never-extinguished flame finds shelter in her pale radiance.

Through storms and conflicts, through raging waters,
She remains steadfast, majestic, though the shore burns in tempests.
O guardian, let truth now rise and reveal:
"I lift my torchâ€”to remake the world!"
