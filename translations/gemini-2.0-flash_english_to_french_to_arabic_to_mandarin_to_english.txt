In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways with fragrant light,

A bronze sentinel embraces the dance of light and shadow.

Each spark awakens a deep and bright longing,

"Mother of Exiles" whispers in the silent night.

A true beacon of liberty, courage ablaze,

"Trust me, lay your weary burdens beneath this golden ray."

As ships of dreams set sail, new shores smile through the haze,

Finding solace beneath her shimmering cloak.

Through storms and strife, as turbulent waves submit,

She remains serene, soothing the coast with gentle murmurs.

Guardian, reveal the true guidance they seek:

"Raise the torch highâ€”in its flame, we shall forge anew!"
