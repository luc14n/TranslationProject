In the arms of a peaceful harbor, the lighthouse's light sways,  
A bronze statue rises where shadows hold their reign.  
Fierce flames burn bright, proud in every spark,  
"The Mother of Exiles," whispers through the dark.  

True symbol of freedom, a bold and blazing vow,  
"Bring me your bruised, your weary, to this welcoming land’s glow."  
New shores promise grace, dream-laden ships set sail,  
A flame that never fades finds refuge in her radiance pale.  

Through storms and strife, where violent waters churn,  
She stands unshaken, majestic, though shores in tempests burn.  
O keeper, let truth now rise and be unfurled:  
"Lift high my flame—remake the world!"
