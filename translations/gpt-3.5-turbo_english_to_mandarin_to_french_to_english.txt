In the tranquil embrace of the bay, the scented lighthouse trembles,
The bronze statue watches over, its strong arms embracing the extended shadows.
Each spark ignites the flame of glory, shimmering with brilliant light,
The "Exiled Mother" whispers a lullaby in the peaceful night.

The essence of freedom is a bright flame,
"Lay your burden at my feet, rest in this golden glow."
As the ship of dreams sails, a new shore is revealed in the light mist,
Beneath her gown encrusted with light, lies the power of healing.

After the storm and the battle, like a ghost, the waves reflect the depth of the soul,
Her gentle words linger around every inch of the coast.
Oh guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise your torches, we will reshape the primal universe in flames!"
