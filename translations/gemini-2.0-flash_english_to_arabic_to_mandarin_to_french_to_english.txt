In the serene bay, the lighthouse softly swings its light,
The bronze keeper stands tall, where light and shadow embrace.
Each spark kindles the strength of longing deep in the soul,
The "Mother of Exiles" breathes softly in the silent night.

A true symbol of freedom, the light of courage shines,
"Bring your tired burdens to this golden gleam."
As ships laden with dreams set sail, new shores rejoice,
Finding solace in the heart of her cloak of eternal glory.

Through storms and battles, when savage waves roar,
It stands silent, the coast yearning once more for the coming of the wind.
Guardian, may truth reveal its call:
"Raise the torch high - in the flames, we shall reshape the world!"
