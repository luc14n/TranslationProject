In the cradle of a tranquil gulf, a beacon of fragrance pulsates,
And a bronze statue watches, its steadfast arms embracing a stretching shadow.
Each spark ignites a blaze of glory, shining with a dazzling light,
"Mother of Exiles" hums a lullaby in the quiet night.

The essence of freedom, a pure flame,
"Lay your burdens at my feet, rest in this golden aura."
And as ships of dreams dock, new shores beckon in a gentle mist,
Beneath her star-studded cloak lies a healing power.

Storms and battles have raged, ghostly waves reflecting the depths of the soul,
Her gentle whisper wanders along the shores, reaching every land.
O guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise the torch â€“ in the flame, we shall rebuild the original universe!"
