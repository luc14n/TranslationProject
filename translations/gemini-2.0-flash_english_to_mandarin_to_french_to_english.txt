In the cradle of a serene bay, a fragrant beacon throbs,
A bronze statue stands guard, her firm arms embracing a lengthening shadow.
Each spark ignites a flame of glory, bursting with dazzling light,
The "Mother of Exiles" hums a lullaby in the peaceful night.

The essence of freedom is a limpid flame,
"Lay down your burdens at my feet, rest in this golden aura."
As dream-ships cast anchor, new shores emerge in a gentle haze,
Beneath her starry skirt, a healing power lies.

Storms and battles have passed, spectral waves mirror the soul's abyss,
Her gentle whisper wanders along the coasts, reaching every land.
O guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise the torch â€“ in the flame, we shall rebuild the original universe!"
