In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways with a fragrant light,
The bronze guardians stand proudly, where light and shadow intertwine.
Every spark ignites the longing deep within,
"The Mother of Exiles" breathes softly on the quiet night.

A true symbol of freedom, a shining courage,
"Believe me, bear your weary burdens with this golden light."
As the ship of dreams sails, new shores rejoice,
Finding peace in the eternal and bright mantle.

Through storms and battles, when the raging waves whisper low,
Stand quietly, as the shore breathes in again.
Guardians, heed the call of truth:
"Hold high the torch of light - in the flames, we shall reshape everything!"
