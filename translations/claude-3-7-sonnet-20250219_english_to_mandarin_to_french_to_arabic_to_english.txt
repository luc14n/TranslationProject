In the cradle of the peaceful gulf, the fragrant lighthouse trembles,
Bronze statues keep vigil, their strong arms embracing the extended shadows.
Each spark ignites the flame of glory, exploding in dazzling brilliance,
"Mother of the exiled" hums a lullaby in the clear night.

The essence of freedom is a pure flame,
"Lay your burden at my feet, and rest in this golden halo."
When the ship of dreams lifts its anchor, new shores appear in the soft mist,
Beneath her star-studded skirt hides a healing power.

Storms and battles have passed, ghostly waves reflect the depths of the soul,
Her gentle whisper travels along the coast, reaching every land.
O Guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Lift the torch â€” in the flame, we shall rebuild the primordial universe!"
