In the calm embrace of the bay, the fragrant lighthouse trembles,
The bronze statue stands alert, its strong arms embracing the extended shadows.
Every spark ignites a flame of glory, shining with captivating brilliance,
"Mother of the Strangers" whispers with the hymns of the still night.

The essence of freedom is a glowing flame,
"Lay down your burdens at my feet, rest in this golden light."
As the ship of dreams sails, a new shore reveals itself in the light mist,
Beneath her skirt studded with light, lies the power of healing.

After the storms and battles, like ghosts, the waves reflect the depth of souls,
Her gentle words roam every inch of the coast.
Oh, guardian, show them the truth they seek:
"Lift your torches, we will rebuild the original universe in the flame!"
