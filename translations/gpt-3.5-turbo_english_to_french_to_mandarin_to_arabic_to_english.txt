In a tranquil harbor, a lighthouse sways with a beam of fragrant light,
A guardian of bronze, light embracing the darkness.
Every spark ignites a bright deep desire,
"The Mother of the Exiled" whispers softly in the ranks of the quiet night.

A true symbol of freedom, a shining courage,
"Believe me, place the burdens of your fatigue under this golden light."
As the ship of dreams sails, the new shore smiles behind the light mist,
Finding solace beneath its shimmering cloak.

Through storms and conflicts, when the fierce waves reveal,
She remains calm, passing with her whispering elegance above the coast.
O guardians, reveal the true guidance they call for:
"Raise the torch - in its blaze, we will recreate every place!"
