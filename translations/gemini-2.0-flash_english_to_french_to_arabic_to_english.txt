In tranquil harbors, lighthouses cradle fragrant light,
Bronze sentinels where light embraces shadows.
Each spark ignites a deep and luminous desire,
"Mother of Exiles" whispers softly in the silent night procession.

A true symbol of freedom, radiant courage,
"Trust in me, lay your weary burdens beneath this golden ray."
As ships of dreams set sail, new shores smile through the mist,
Finding solace beneath the ripples of her shimmering cloak.

Through tempests and strife, as raging waves confess,
She remains serene, refreshing coasts with her murmuring grace.
O guardians, unveil the true guide of their call:
"Raise the torch high - in its fire, we shall recreate every place!"
