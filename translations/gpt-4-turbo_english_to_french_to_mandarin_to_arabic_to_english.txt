In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways with a thread of fragrant light,
The bronze guardian embraces the darkness with light.
Every spark ignites a deep and dazzling desire,
"The Mother of Exile" whispers quietly in the silent night procession.

The true symbol of freedom, the sparkling courage,
"Trust in me, lay down your weary burdens under this golden light."
As the ship of dreams sails, the new shore smiles through the light mist,
Finding solace under her shimmering cloak.

Through storms and conflicts, when the fierce waves confess their secrets,
She remains calm, caressing the shore with elegance and whispering.
Oh, guardians, reveal the true direction they seek:
"Raise the torches - in their flame, we shall reshape every place!"
