In the harbor's embrace, the lighthouse's radiance gleams,
A copper colossus stands firm in the night.
The flame burns fierce and proud,
"Mother of Exiles" whispers softly through the mist.

True symbol of freedom, her pledge steadfast and clear,
"Bring your tired, your poor, let this land welcome them."
New shores promise grace, ships of dreams set sail,
The never-extinguished torch, its light never fading.

Through storms and tumult, wild waters roar,
She stands unmoved, though tempests lash the shore.
O guardian, call out with a voice that's true:
"Lift high my flameâ€”let the world shine anew!"
