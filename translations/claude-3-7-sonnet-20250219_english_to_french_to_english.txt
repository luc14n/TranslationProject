In the harbor's embrace, a lighthouse shines bright,
A bronze colossus, awakening dreams in the night.
With a flame of pride and warmth so vast,
"Mother of Exiles," her whispered hope implied.

Symbol of liberty, a promise so true,
"Welcome your tired, your poor ones too."
Land of new vows, where dreams take flight,
A beacon of hope, blazing with might.

Through tumultuous waters and untamed seas,
She stands unwavering, across her vast domain.
A monument calling to protect freedom's plea,
"Lift high my torch, for the whole world to see."
