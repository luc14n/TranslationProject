In a calm harbor, a lighthouse sways with a fragrant glow,
A bronze guardian embraces the shadow with his majestic arm.
Each spark ignites a burning desire, shining with radiant light,
"The mother of exile" softly sings in a peaceful night.

The essence of freedom is a shining gleam,
"Entrust me with the burden of your weariness, rest in this golden halo."
As the ship of dreams sails, new shores smile beyond the light mist,
You will find solace under its luminous cloak.

After enduring storms and conflicts, like the sea waves revealing the soul,
She remains serene, embracing the shores with gentle words.
Oh guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise the torch, in the flames, we shall rebuild the sky and the earth!"
