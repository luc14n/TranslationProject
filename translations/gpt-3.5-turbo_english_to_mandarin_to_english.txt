In the embrace of the harbor, a lighthouse shines,
A bronze giant, igniting dreams in the night.
With proud and warm flames,
"The Mother of Exiles," whispers hope's hint.

A symbol of freedom, such a true promise,
"Welcome tired ones, your poor."
A new land of oaths, dreams set sail,
A lighthouse of hope, burning with strength.

Through turbulent waters and untamed seas,
She stands tall in her vast domain.
A monument calling for the defense of freedom,
"Raise my torch high, let the world benefit."
