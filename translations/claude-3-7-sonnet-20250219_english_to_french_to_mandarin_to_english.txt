In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways with fragrant radiance,
The bronze sentinel embraces shadows with magnificent arms.
Each spark ignites an eager longing, dazzlingly brilliant,
The "Mother of Exiles" softly hums in night's silent procession.

Freedom's essence is a luminous courage,
"Give to me your tired burdens, place them in this golden halo."
When ships of dreams set sail, new shores smile through the mist,
Finding solace beneath her shimmering robes.

Through storms and conflicts, like waves revealing their soul,
She remains serene, soothing shores with graceful whispers.
Oh, guardian, reveal the truth they seek:
"Lift high the torchâ€”in flames we shall remake heaven and earth!"
