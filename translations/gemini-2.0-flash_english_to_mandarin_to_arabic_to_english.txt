In the tranquil embrace of the Gulf, the fragrant beacon trembles,
Guarded by a bronze statue, its strong arms hug the stretching shadows.
Every spark ignites the flame of glory, shimmering with radiant light,
The "Mother of Exiles" whispers a lullaby in the serene night.

The essence of freedom is an incandescent blaze,
"Lay your burdens at my feet, and rest in this golden light."
When ships of dreams sail, in the delicate mist, new shores appear,
Beneath her robe embroidered with light, lies the power of healing.

After storms and battles, like a specter, the waves mirror the depths of the soul,
Her gentle words still encircle every inch of the shore.
O guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise your torches, and we shall reshape the primeval universe in flame!"
