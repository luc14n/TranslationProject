In the quiet embrace of the bay, the scented lighthouse trembles,
The bronze statue watches over, its sturdy arms embracing the sprawling shadows.
Each spark ignites the flame of glory, shining with a dazzling brilliance,
The "Mother of Exiles" whispers lullabies in the peaceful night.

The essence of freedom is a bright flame,
"Lay down your burdens at my feet, rest in this golden light."
When the ship of dreams sets sail, a new shore unveils in the light mist,
Beneath her skirt encrusted with light, hides the power of healing.

After the storms and battles, like ghosts, the waves reflect the depth of souls,
Her tender words wander over every inch of the coast.
Oh, guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise your torches, we will rebuild the original universe in the flames!"
