In the embrace of the harbor, a shining beacon,
A giant of bronze, an inspiring sight.
With a lofty lamp, and warm radiance,
"Mother of Refugees," a dream softly spoken.
A symbol of freedom, a true promise,
"Give me your tired, your poor."
The land of promises, where dreams soar,
Beacon of hope, glowing with strength.
Across the turbulent seas and vast oceans,
It stands as a beacon, beside its expanse.
A monument to the call of freedom,
"Lift my lamp, for all."
