In the tranquil embrace of the Gulf, the fragrant lighthouse quivers,  
Bronze statues watch, their mighty arms embracing the creeping shadow.  
Each spark ignites the fire of glory, bursting into dazzling flashes,  
"Mother of the Exiles" whispers a gentle song in the silent night.  

The essence of freedom is a pure flame,  
"Lay your burdens at my feet, rest in this golden trace."  
When dream ships raise their anchors, new shores emerge in the soft mist,  
Beneath her lantern-studded hem lies a healing power.  

Storms and battles past, phantom waves mirror the soul's depths,  
Her tender whispers wander along the coast, over every patch of land.  
O guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:  
"Lift the torch highâ€”we shall rebuild the primal universe in flame!"
