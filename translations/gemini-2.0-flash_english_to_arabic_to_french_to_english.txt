In the haven of a tranquil port, the beacon's light pirouettes,
And a bronze sentinel stands where shadows gather deepest.
Tongues of fierce fire bloom in every spark,
"Mother of Exiles," she breathes through the dark.

A true icon of liberty, a vow bold and bright,
"Bring me your wounds, your weariness, to this welcoming light."
New shores whisper of joy, and ships laden with dreams set sail,
An unquenchable flame finds solace in her pale veil.

Through tempest and strife, where churning waters roar,
She stands tall, majestic, though storm-scorched shores implore.
O guardian, let truth now rise and unfurl:
"Raise my torch highâ€”and let us remold the world!"
