In the embrace of a gentle harbor, the lighthouse's glow plays,
A bronze silhouette stands, where shadows reign.
The flames burn fiercely, with pride in every spark,
"The mother of refugees," whispers in the darkness.

A true symbol of freedom, a bold and luminous commitment,
"Bring me the wretched and the weary, to the light of this welcoming land."
New shores promise grace, ships of dreams prepare to sail,
A flame that never dies, finds refuge in its glow.

Through storms and conflicts, where waters boil violently,
She stands tall, despite the shores ablaze under the tempests.
Oh guardian, may truth make its stand now:
"Hold my flame high - reshape, and renew the land!"
