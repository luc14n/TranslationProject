In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse light gently sways,
The bronze guardian stands at the intersection of shadow and light.
Each spark ignites the strength of a burning passion,
The "mother of exiles" breathes in the silence of night.

True symbol of freedom, radiating courage,
"Bring your exhausted burdens toward this golden glow."
When ships laden with dreams sail, new shores whisper,
Finding comfort in the heart of her robe of eternal light.

Through storms and battles, where wild currents roar,
She stands motionless, though the coast still yearns for wind.
O guardian, let truth reveal its claim:
"Raise the torch â€” we shall remake the world in flames!"
