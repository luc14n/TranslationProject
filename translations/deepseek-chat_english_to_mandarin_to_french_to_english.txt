In the tranquil cradle of the bay, the aromatic lighthouse quivers,  
Bronze statues stand watch, their sturdy arms embracing the creeping shadow.  
Each spark ignites a blaze of glory, bursts forth in blinding flashes,  
"The Mother of Exiles" hums a lullaby in the peaceful night.  

The essence of liberty is a clear flame,  
"Lay your burdens at my feet, rest in this golden aura."  
When dream-ships weigh anchor, new shores emerge in the gentle haze,  
Beneath her star-studded skirt lies a healing power.  

Storms and battles past, ghostly waves mirror the soul's abyss,  
Her tender whispers wander along the coastline, over every patch of land.  
O Guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:  
"Lift high the torchâ€”we shall rebuild the primal universe in flames!"
