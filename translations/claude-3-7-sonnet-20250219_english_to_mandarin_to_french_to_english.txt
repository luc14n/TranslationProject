In the cradle of the tranquil bay, the perfumed lighthouse quivers,
Bronze statues keep watch, their solid arms embracing the stretching shadows.
Each spark ignites the flame of glory, bursting forth in dazzling brilliance,
The "Mother of exiles" hums a lullaby in the serene night.

The essence of liberty is a clear flame,
"Lay your burden at my feet, rest in this golden halo."
When the ship of dreams weighs anchor, new shores emerge in the gentle mist,
Beneath her starry skirt hides a healing power.

Storms and battles have passed, ghostly waves reflect the abysses of the soul,
Her soft whisper wanders along the coastline, reaching every land.
O guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise the torch â€” in the flame, we shall rebuild the primordial universe!"
