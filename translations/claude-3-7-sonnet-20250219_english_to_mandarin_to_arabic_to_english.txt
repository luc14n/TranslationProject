In the quiet harbor, the lighthouse of fragrance sways,
Guarded by a bronze statue, and strong arms embracing extended shadows.
Each spark ignites a glorious flame, shimmering with brilliant light,
"Mother of Strangers" hums a lullaby in the stillness of the night.

The essence of freedom is a glowing flame,
"Lay your burdens at my feet, and rest in this golden light."
When the ship of dreams sails, new shores appear in the soft mist,
And beneath her robe embroidered with lights, lies the power of healing.

Through storms and battles, like a phantom reflecting waves to the soul,
Her gentle words still surround every inch of the coast.
Oh, guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise your torches, and in the flame we shall reshape the original universe!"
