In the tranquil embrace of the Gulf, the beacon sways with the fragrance of light,
And the towering bronze eye cradles the shadows in its arms.
Each spark ignites the flame of longing, its gleam ablaze,
And the "Mother of Exiles" hums tender hymns in the silence of the night.

The essence of liberty is a radiant light,
"Come, lay your weary burdens in the golden halo of light."
And the ships of dreams set sail, and new shores smile in the mist,
Finding solace in her shimmering robe.

Through storms and strife, as the wave reveals the soul,
She remains serene, caressing the shores with gentle whispers.
O guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise the torches high â€“ for in the flame, we shall reshape the earth and sky!"
