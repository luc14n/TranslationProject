In tranquil harbors, lighthouses sway with tender light,
Bronze sentinels stand tall, where light and shadow intertwine.
Each spark ignites the longing deep within,
The "Mother of Exiles" breathes softly in the silent night.

A true symbol of liberty, courage gleaming bright,
"Give me your tired burdens to this golden light."
As ships of dreams set sail, new shores cheer with delight,
Finding solace in its eternal, radiant gown.

Through storms and battles, when wild waves roar,
It stands in silence, as the coast yearns for wind once more.
Guardians, let truth reveal its call:
"Raise high the torchâ€”in flames, we shall remake all!"
