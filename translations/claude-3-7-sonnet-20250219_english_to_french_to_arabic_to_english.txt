In quiet harbors, lighthouses cradle a scented light,
Bronze guardians stand where light embraces shadows.
Each spark awakens a deep and luminous desire,
"Mother of the exiled" whispers gently through the silent night procession.

A true symbol of freedom, a glowing courage,
"Trust me, place your weary burdens beneath this golden beam."
When ships of dreams sail, new shores smile through the fog,
To find peace under the ripples of her sparkling cloak.

Through storms and conflicts, while raging waves confess,
She remains calm, refreshing coastlines with her murmuring grace.
O guardians, reveal the true guide to their call:
"Lift the torch high - in its fire, we shall recreate every place!"
