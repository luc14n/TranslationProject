In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse's light dances,
Bronze guardians stand where shadows converge.
Each spark ignites a fierce flame,
"The Mother of Exiles" breathes in the darkness.

A true symbol of freedom, a brave and bright vow,
"Bring me your pain and weariness, step into this warm light."
The new shore whispers softly, ships laden with dreams set sail,
The undying flame finds solace in her bright garments.

Amidst storms and conflicts, where waves surge powerfully,
She stands solemn and calm, though the shores crave the fervent wind.
Oh, guardian, let truth rise and spread:
"Lift my torchâ€”let us reshape the world!"
