In the tranquil haven where the lighthouse's light dances,  
A bronzed sentinel stands tall in the shadow of beams.  
Each spark ignites a proud flame,  
"The Mother of exiles" breathes in the darkness.  

Burning symbol of freedom, promise of radiant courage,  
"Entrust your sorrows and weariness to this comforting glow."  
The new shore whispers, vessels laden with dreams set sail,  
In her gown of light, the eternal flame finds solace.  

Between storm and struggle, furious waves roar,  
Unmoving she remains, though the shore calls the scorching winds.  
O Watchman, let truth unfurl triumphant:  
"Lift high the torchâ€”we shall rebuild the world!"
