In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways its fragrant beams,  
Bronze sentinels stand tall where light and shadow embrace.  
Each spark awakens a fervent longing deep within,  
The "Mother of Exiles" breathes softly through the silent night.  

O true symbol of freedom, ablaze with valor's flame,  
"Trust in me—lay down your weary burdens beneath this gilded glow."  
As vessels of dreams set sail toward smiling shores anew,  
Find solace in the eternal shimmer of her radiant robes.  

Through tempests and strife, when wrathful waves whisper low,  
She remains serene, her breath a balm to every coast.  
O Guardian, unveil the truth their voices seek:  
"Raise high the torch—we shall forge all anew in fire’s embrace!"  

*(Note: The translation weaves together imagery such as "gilded glow," "radiant robes," and "forge all anew in fire’s embrace," preserving the Arabic original's solemn metaphorical tone while echoing classical Chinese poetry’s lyrical brevity. "Mother of Exiles" faithfully renders "أم المنفيين" as a sanctuary symbol, aligning with Chinese four-character phrasing aesthetics. The closing line’s phrasing—"forge all anew"—captures both the revolutionary spirit and subtly resonates with the *I Ching*’s philosophy: "Life unceasing is change.")*
