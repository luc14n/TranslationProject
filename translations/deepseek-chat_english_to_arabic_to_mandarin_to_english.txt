In the tranquil harbor, where lighthouse beams softly sway,  
Bronze sentinels stand where light and shadow play.  
Each spark ignites a fervent pyre's might,  
"Mother of Exiles" breathes in the hush of night.  

True emblem of freedom, courage's radiant vow,  
"Bring your weary burdens to this golden glow."  
New shores murmur low as dream-laden ships depart,  
Finding solace in her luminous robe's eternal heart.  

Through tempests and battles where wild currents roar,  
She stands serene though shores crave winds once more.  
O guardian, let truth unfurl its claim:  
"Lift high the torchâ€”we'll forge the world anew in flame!"
