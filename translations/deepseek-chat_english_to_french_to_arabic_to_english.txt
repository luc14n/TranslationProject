In tranquil havens, lighthouses cradle fragrant light,  
Bronzed sentinels stand tall where glow embraces shade.  
Each spark awakens a yearning deep and bright,  
"Mother of exiles" breathes soft through night's quiet parade.  

True emblem of liberty, courage ablaze,  
"Trust me, lay weary burdens 'neath this gilded ray."  
When dream-ships sail, new shores smile through the haze,  
Finding peace 'neath her shimmering mantle's sway.  

Through storms and strife, as raging waves confide,  
She stands serene, reviving coasts with whispered grace.  
O keepers, unveil their call's true guide:  
"Lift the torch highâ€”in its fire, we'll remake every space!"
