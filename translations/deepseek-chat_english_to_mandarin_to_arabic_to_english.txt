In the tranquil harbor, the fragrant beacon sways,
Guarded by a bronze statue with strong arms embracing the stretching shadows.
Every spark ignites a radiant flame, shimmering with dazzling brilliance,
"Mother of Strangers" hums a lullaby in the still night's darkness.

The essence of freedom is a blazing flame,
"Lay your burdens at my feet, and rest in this golden light."
When dream ships sail, new shores wave beyond the soft mist,
Beneath her cloak embroidered with lights, lies the power of healing.

Through storms and battles, like waves reflecting spirits' ghosts,
She still envelops every inch of the shore with her tender words.
O guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise your torches high, in the fire's flame we shall reshape the primal universe!"
