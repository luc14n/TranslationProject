In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways a fragrant beam of light,
Bronze sentinels, embracing darkness with their brightness.
Each spark ignites a deep and dazzling longing,
"The Mother of Exiles" whispers softly in the silent parade of night.

The true symbol of freedom, courage radiating brilliantly,
"Trust me, lay down your weary burdens under this golden light."
As the ship of dreams sets sail, a new shore smiles through the light mist,
Finding solace beneath her twinkling cloak.

Through storms and conflicts, as wild waves speak their hearts,
She remains calm, gracefully caressing the shore, whispering low.
Oh, guardians, reveal the true direction they seek:
"Lift the torch - in its flame, we shall reshape every place!"
