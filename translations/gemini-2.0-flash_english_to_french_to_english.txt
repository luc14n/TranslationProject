In the harbor's embrace, a beacon gleams,
A bronze giant, kindling dreams in the night.
With a flame of pride and warmth so wide,
"Mother of Exiles," her whispered hope implies.

Symbol of liberty, a promise so true,
"Welcome your weary, your poor ones too."
Land of new vows, where dreams take flight,
A beacon of hope, blazing with might.

Through churning waters and untamed seas,
She stands unwavering, on her vast domain.
A monument calling to guard freedom's pleas,
"Lift high my torch, for all the world to gain."
