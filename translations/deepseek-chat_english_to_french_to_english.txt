In the haven's embrace, a beacon shines bright,  
A bronze colossus, stirring dreams in the night.  
With a flame of pride and warmth so wide,  
"Mother of Exiles," her whispered hope implied.  

Symbol of freedom, a promise so true,  
"Take in your weary, your poor ones too."  
Land of new vows, where dreams take flight,  
A lighthouse of hope, blazing with might.  

Through stormy waters and oceans untamed,  
She stands unshaken, by her vast domain.  
A monument calling to guard libertyâ€™s plea,  
"Lift high my torch, for all the world to see."
