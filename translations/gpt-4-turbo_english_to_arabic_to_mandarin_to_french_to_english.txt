In the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse light dances,
The bronze keeper stands where shadows converge.
Each spark ignites a fervent flame,
The "Mother of Exiles" breathes in the darkness.

True symbol of freedom, a brave and bright oath,
"Bring your pains and weariness, step into this warm light."
The new shores laugh softly, ships laden with dreams set sail,
The eternal flame finds comfort in its luminous garments.

In storms and conflicts, where the waves are tumultuous,
She remains solemn and calm, though the shores crave a fierce wind.
Oh, guardian, let truth rise and spread:
"Lift high my torch - let's remake the world!"
