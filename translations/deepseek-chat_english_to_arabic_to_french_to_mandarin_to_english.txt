In the cradle of the tranquil harbor, the lighthouse sways its luminous dance,  
Bronze colossus standing firm where shadows hold dominion.  
Fierce flames roar, each spark a rebel's defiance born,  
"Mother of Exiles" murmurs through the gloaming.  

Freedom's essence is a blazing vow untamed,  
"Give me your battered, your spent—I'll guide them to this promised radiance."  
New shores whisper grace, vessels of dreams await their tide,  
Sanctuary found within her torch's eternal flame.  

At the storm's furious heart, where wrathful tides collide,  
She stands unshaken though thunder ignites the fractured skies.  
O Sentinel, reveal truth now in this hallowed hour:  
"Lift high my fire—remake the world, let all be born anew!"  

(Note: "Rebel's defiance" evokes the proud sparks' spirit, while "colossus"/"Mother of Exiles" preserves cultural resonance. "Fractured skies" poetically transposes storm-lit shores, and the imperative "remake the world" amplifies the statue's divine agency through vivid personification.)
