In the embrace of the gentle harbor, the lighthouse's light shines,
A bronze figure stands tall, with darkness reigning within.
The flames burn, each spark proud and fierce,
"The Mother of Refugees" whispers in the dark.

A true symbol of freedom, a brave and bright promise,
"Bring those weary and downtrodden, towards the light of this land of warmth."
The new shore promises grace, as dream ships prepare to set sail,
A never-dying flame, seeking refuge in its glow.

Through storms and conflicts, the waters there churn fiercely,
She stands strong, even as the coast burns in the storm.
Oh, guardian, let truth now fulfill your stance:
"Raise my flame high - reshape, renew this land!"
