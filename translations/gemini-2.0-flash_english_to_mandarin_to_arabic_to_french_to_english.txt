In the Gulf's serene embrace, the perfumed lighthouse shivers,
Kept by a bronze statue, its mighty arms hugging stretching shadows.
Each spark ignites a glory-flame, glittering with flamboyant sheen,
"Mother of Exiles" hums a lullaby in the tranquil night.

The essence of liberty is a white-hot ember,
"Lay down your burdens at my feet, and rest in this golden glimmer."
When dream-ships sail, in the delicate haze, new shores appear,
Under her cloak embroidered with light, resides a healing power.

After storms and battles, ghost-like, the waves reflect the soul's deep,
Her gentle words continue to embrace every inch of shore.
O guardian, reveal to them the truth they seek:
"Raise your torches, and we shall remold the primal cosmos in flame!"
