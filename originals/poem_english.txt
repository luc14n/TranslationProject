In harbor's embrace, a beacon bright,
A giant of bronze, a hopeful sight.
With lamp aloft, a welcoming gleam,
"Mother of Exiles," a whispered dream.
A symbol of freedom, a promise true,
"Give me your tired, your huddled, too."
A land of promise, where dreams take flight,
A beacon of hope, burning ever so bright.
Through stormy seas, and oceans wide,
She stands a sentinel, by her tide.
A monument to liberty's call,
"I lift my lamp, for one and all."
